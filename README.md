# Roblox-Screen

This small project i was working on i tried recreating a real life screen which acts as a bunch of small pixels and a few algorithms, with alot of crashes ðŸ”¥

# How to use

To use this you can create and make your own type of "operating systems" to display on the screen it creates, although this dosen't have alot of functions to use its mostly 2D but 3D should be possible if you know how to code that.

It has a loader (local script) which loads the screen. Then i have a ModuleScript called BIOS which is the one that starts the systems you or have set to be used. Feel free to tryout some cool stuff with this

You can set a resolution that it will create along with the size of the pixels which you also decide how large they are.
